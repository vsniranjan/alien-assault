# Game Overview

This is a GUI-based game I have built with Python. Below is a summary of the game and its features:

- **Game Type:** One-player shooting game.
- **Objective:** Shoot down enemy ships (Aliens) before they reach the baseline.
- **Scoring:** 
  - Each enemy ship shot down adds a point to your score.
  - After the game ends, you can enter your name to save your score in the leaderboard.
- **Leaderboard:**
  - Accessible via the leaderboard button in the main menu.
  - Displays the names of the top 10 players, their scores, and the dates they achieved them.
- **Acknowledgements:** 
  - Huge thanks to Tim Ruscica (@techwithtim) for getting me started with Pygame and helping me learn it.
