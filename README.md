This is the first GUI-based game I have built with Python. Below is a summary of the game and its features:

**Game Type:** One-player shooting game.

**Objective:** Shoot down enemy ships (Aliens) before they reach the baseline.

**Scoring:** Each enemy ship shot down adds a point to your score. After the game ends, you can enter your name to save your score in the leaderboard.

**Leaderboard:** Accessible via the leaderboard button in the main menu.
Displays the names of the top 10 players, their scores, and the dates they achieved them.
Information is retrieved from the scores.csv file.

**Acknowledgements:** Huge thanks to Tim Ruscica (@techwithtim) for getting me started with Pygame and helping me learn it.

**How to Run the Game**
Ensure Pygame is installed.
Unzip the provided folder.
Run the main.py file.
